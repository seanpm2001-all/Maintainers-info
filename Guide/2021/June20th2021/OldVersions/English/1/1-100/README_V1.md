# Guide for maintainers

## Goals

Here are some goals for helping to maintain my projects.

### Small maintenance goals

1. Click the linguist language list at least once every 6 months, so that the language data is indexed, and there isn't a ~1 minute wait to see it.

2. Fix language and grammatical typos and archive the revision in a new file

### Medium maintenance goals

1. Complete tasks mentioned in issues

2. Added a *.txt file extension to the singular license

3. Start a discussion, and archive it in 4 parts

4. Raise an issue with a feature request

5. Update the `README.md` file to match other projects

6. Work with me on making a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file

7. Work with me on making 1 or more project language file(s) for the project

## Notes

You have a scope of all my projects to work with, despite certain rules that need to be changed, although you must still follow the other rules. If a rule is limiting you from maintaining a project, contact me, and I will fix it.

You must create a pull request for each set of changes. Message me when the PR is ready.

**THIS LISTING IS INCOMPLETE AND IS GOING TO BE CHANGED. THIS IS ONLY AN EARLY DRAFT**

### Self notes

Note to self: I should create some videos for showing how to maintain. 1080p is an OK resolution for you, right? I don't have a 1440p or higher screen.
